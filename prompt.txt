Refactor an API Orchestration Layer

You are a senior Python engineer working in a small but realistic codebase that implements a thin HTTP API orchestration layer on top of multiple downstream services.

Your task is to refactor the existing implementation to reduce duplication and clarify responsibilities in the API layer, while strictly preserving all externally observable behavior.
This is a refactor, not a rewrite.

---

## Repository Context

The repository already contains a working implementation and tests:

- `api_engine.py` — API orchestration implementation
- `tests/test_api_engine.py` — pytest suite

The engine exposes a small, stable API surface that other components use to call downstream HTTP services.

You must improve structure and maintainability in `api_engine.py` while keeping all tests green and all externally visible behavior identical.

You may add internal modules or tests, but you must not change public‑facing behavior.

---

## Core Objective

Refactor the API orchestration layer in `api_engine.py` to remove structural duplication in:

- Request construction
- Response normalization
- Error mapping and tracing

while:

1. Keeping the public API surface identical.
2. Preserving runtime behavior, including edge cases and quirks.
3. Keeping existing tests and their assertions valid.

Typical pain points include duplicated logic across sync vs async paths and multiple endpoints for:

- Building requests (URL, headers, query params, body serialization)
- Retry and timeout handling
- Mapping underlying failures to domain‑level error codes
- Emitting trace / log events

Your goal is to introduce a clearer structure that reduces duplication and makes behavior easier to reason about, without changing outcomes.

---

## Public API

The following public entrypoints must remain callable in exactly the same way, with the same semantics:

- `ApiEngine.call_sync(ctx, endpoint_name, raw_payload)`
- `ApiEngine.call_async(ctx, endpoint_name, raw_payload)`

Where:

- `ctx` is a per‑request context (IDs, settings, etc.).
- `endpoint_name` resolves to an endpoint configuration.
- `raw_payload` is a raw JSON string (or similar) interpreted by the engine.

The type and structure of returned objects must not change (field names, meanings, error category strings).

You must not rename these methods, change parameters, or change return shapes. Any helpers you add must be internal and must not alter this contract.

---

## Behavior Invariants

Several less obvious behaviors must remain exactly the same after the refactor. Tests enforce these and they reflect integration constraints. Your refactor must preserve at least the following categories:

1. **Endpoint Resolution & Defaults**
  - Endpoint configuration from `endpoint_name` keeps the same defaults (base URL, HTTP method, per‑endpoint timeout, retry policy).
  - Unknown endpoints still produce the existing error category, not raw exceptions.

2. **Request Construction**
  - Headers are built by merging engine defaults, endpoint headers, and per‑call overrides from `ctx` in the same precedence order.
  - Query params and bodies are serialized and encoded the same way, including handling of `None`, empty values, and JSON encoding errors.

3. **Error Mapping**
  - HTTP status codes and network errors map to the same domain‑level error categories.
  - Timeouts, connection failures, protocol errors, JSON decode failures, and schema mismatches keep their existing categories.
  - The mapping from underlying exceptions to error strings must not change.

4. **Sync vs Async Semantics**
  - `call_sync` and `call_async` remain behaviorally equivalent for success and failure, aside from execution model.
  - Any special handling for nested / already‑running event loops and how such errors are wrapped must be preserved.

5. **Tracing / Logging Events**
  - The engine emits trace or log events for key lifecycle moments (resolve endpoint, build request, dispatch start/end, error mapping).
  - Event names, payload fields, and order must not change, including any copying of payloads before emission.

6. **Caching / Idempotency (If Present)**
  - Any existing cache or idempotency behavior must keep the same keys, short‑circuit rules, and avoidance of extra work on cache hits.

---

## Refactor Targets

Within these constraints, focus on:

- Removing duplication between `call_sync` and `call_async` by centralizing common logic for:
  - Parsing and validating `raw_payload`
  - Resolving endpoint configuration
  - Constructing and normalizing requests
  - Mapping errors and emitting trace / log events
- Introducing a small number of clearly named helpers or internal classes to clarify control flow.
- Keeping the call sequence stable: resolve → build → send → normalize → map errors → emit events.

Prefer straightforward, concrete abstractions over generic frameworks. The goal is to make `api_engine.py` easier to navigate and less error‑prone, not to redesign the system.

---

## Testing and Environment

- Use `pytest` as the test runner.
- Do not introduce new runtime dependencies beyond the Python standard library and `pytest`.
- Public interfaces and external entrypoints must not change.

You MUST keep all existing tests and their assertions intact. You MAY add new tests, but they must only tighten behavior (for example, covering sync vs async equivalence, trace payload immutability, retry boundaries, or cache semantics) and must not broaden or relax any behavior.

Provide a simple `run_tests` entrypoint script that:

- Sets up a reusable local environment (for example, a virtual environment using the standard library).
- Installs required dependencies.
- Runs the full pytest suite.

Running `./run_tests` in the project root must be enough to verify behavior preservation.

---

## Execution Notes

- Read and understand the existing implementation and tests before changing structure.
- Identify the most duplicated logic and extract it carefully, guided by existing tests.
- Run tests frequently while refactoring to catch behavior changes early.
- Minimize diff noise on unrelated code (avoid drive‑by renames or reformatting).
